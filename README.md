# Alberto Martinez Garcia - Data Analysis Portfolio
Hello, my name is Alberto! I created this portfolio to: 
1. Showcase what I have been learning throughout many courses and projects in Data Analytics and Machine Learning
2. Be able to track my progress
 
In the past, I worked in Sales as a Key Account Manager; but currently, I want to transition into Data Analytics, as I discovered that it is one of my passions.
